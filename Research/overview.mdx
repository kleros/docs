# Research

Kleros is grounded in academic research spanning cryptoeconomics, game theory, social choice theory, and legal studies. The protocol's design draws on peer-reviewed publications, and the team actively collaborates with researchers and institutions to advance the field of decentralized justice.

## Research Areas

**Cryptoeconomics & Mechanism Design** — The incentive structures, voting systems, and attack resistance properties of the Kleros protocol. This includes Schelling point mechanisms, penalty/reward systems, and analysis of griefing attacks.

**Social Choice Theory** — Voting aggregation methods for multi-option disputes, including analysis of clone independence, Condorcet properties, and manipulation resistance across Plurality, Ranked Pairs, Schulze, and other systems.

**Random Number Generation** — Secure on-chain randomness for juror selection, covering Chainlink VRF, threshold signatures, and verifiable delay functions.

**Legal & Regulatory** — The status of decentralized arbitration under existing legal frameworks, enforceability of on-chain rulings, and the relationship between blockchain dispute resolution and traditional ODR (Online Dispute Resolution).

**Identity & Sybil Resistance** — Proof of Humanity as a foundation for one-person-one-vote systems, soulbound tokens, and PoH-gated jury selection.

## Kleros Fellowship of Justice

The Fellowship of Justice program, launched in 2018, builds a community of researchers and practitioners contributing to decentralized justice. Fellows have researched topics including decentralized justice for environmental conflicts, blockchain-based dispute resolution in Brazil, AI-art copyright disputes, and scientific misconduct adjudication.

## Doctoral Research Grant

Kleros has established the **Kleros Doctoral Research Support Grant** in partnership with the computer science department of the University of Oxford to co-fund doctoral research in areas relevant to decentralized dispute resolution.
