# Court V1 (Legacy)

<Warning>
Court V1 is superseded by [Court V2](/court/overview) on Arbitrum. Use V2 for all new activity.
</Warning>

Kleros Court V1 was the original decentralized dispute resolution protocol deployed on Ethereum Mainnet in 2018. The core smart contract was **KlerosLiquid**, which combined juror staking, random selection, voting, and dispute management in a single contract.

---

## Key Characteristics

- **Network**: Ethereum Mainnet (also deployed on Gnosis Chain / xDAI)
- **Contract**: KlerosLiquid (monolithic — all logic in one contract)
- **PNK Staking**: PNK remained in the juror's wallet during staking
- **RNG**: Blockhash-based random number generation
- **Voting**: Commit-reveal with plurality aggregation
- **Standards**: ERC-792 (Arbitration) and ERC-1497 (Evidence)
- **Courts**: Hierarchical subcourt tree with General Court as root

## V1 vs V2 Comparison

| Feature | V1 | V2 |
|---------|----|----|
| Network | Ethereum Mainnet | Arbitrum One |
| Architecture | Monolithic (KlerosLiquid) | Modular (KlerosCore + SortitionModule + DisputeKits) |
| Evidence | Handled by arbitrable contracts | Handled by Court |
| Appeals | Handled by arbitrable contracts | Handled by Court |
| RNG | Blockhash | Chainlink VRF with fallback |
| Cross-chain | Single chain | Multi-chain via VEA bridge |
| Gas costs | High | Low |

## V1 Court Structure

V1 had a similar hierarchical court tree to V2, with the General Court as root and specialized subcourts including Blockchain Non-Technical, English Language, Onboarding, and others. Staking in a child court automatically included the juror in all parent courts.
