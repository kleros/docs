# Curate V1 (Legacy)

<Warning>
Curate V1 is superseded by [Curate V2](/products/curate) on Arbitrum.
</Warning>

Curate V1 was the original decentralized registry application deployed on Ethereum Mainnet. It enabled anyone to create and maintain community-curated registries (Token Curated Registries / TCRs) with crypto-economic incentives and Kleros Court dispute resolution.

## V1 Architecture

Curate V1 came in two variants:

**Classic Curate** — Stored all item data directly in contract storage. Offered maximum flexibility and on-chain queryability, but with higher gas costs (storage costs scaled with item count).

**Light Curate** — Stored only the item's IPFS multihash in the contract, with full item data indexed via The Graph's subgraph. Significantly cheaper to deploy and use (~700k gas for new TCR deployment vs ~7 million for Classic, using EIP-1167 minimal proxies).

Most production registries used Light Curate for cost efficiency. V2 continues this approach.

## Key Registries (V1)

- **Token Registry (T2CR)** — Verified token submissions used by wallets and exchanges
- **Address Tags Registry** — Human-readable labels for Ethereum addresses, used by block explorers
- **CDN Registry** — Token logos and metadata served to dApps

These registries were the data layer behind [Kleros Scout](/products/scout).

## Migration

V2 Curate is deployed on Arbitrum with lower gas costs and the same TCR mechanics. Existing V1 registries remain accessible but new registries should be created on V2. See the [Migration Guide](/legacy/migration-guide).
