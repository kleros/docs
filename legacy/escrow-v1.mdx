# Escrow V1 (Legacy)

<Warning>
Escrow V1 is superseded by [Escrow V2](/products/escrow) on Arbitrum.
</Warning>

Kleros Escrow V1 was the original decentralized escrow platform on Ethereum Mainnet. It allowed two parties to lock funds in a smart contract, with Kleros Court available as a dispute resolution mechanism if the parties disagreed.

## Key Differences from V2

| Feature | V1 | V2 |
|---------|----|----|
| Network | Ethereum Mainnet | Arbitrum One |
| Token Support | ETH only | ETH + any ERC-20 token |
| Settlement | Basic | Structured proposal/counter-proposal |
| Platform Fees | None | None |
| Evidence/Appeals | Handled by escrow contract | Handled by Court |

V2 introduced structured settlement negotiation, multi-token support, and moved evidence and appeal handling to the Court, simplifying the escrow contract. See [Escrow V2](/products/escrow) for current documentation.
