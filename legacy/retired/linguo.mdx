# Linguo (Retired)

<Warning>
Linguo has been retired and is no longer actively maintained.
</Warning>

**Kleros Linguo** was a decentralized translation marketplace where translation requesters could post jobs, translators could claim and complete them, and quality disputes were resolved by Kleros Court.

The platform used an escrow mechanism: payment was locked when a translation task was created and released to the translator upon completion. If the requester or a third-party challenger disputed the translation quality, Kleros jurors with language expertise would evaluate the work.

## Why It Was Retired

- Niche user base made sustained growth difficult
- High Ethereum gas costs made small translation jobs uneconomical
- Development resources redirected to core products with broader adoption
