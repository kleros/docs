# Moderate (Retired)

<Warning>
Moderate has been retired and is no longer actively maintained.
</Warning>

**Kleros Moderate** was a Telegram bot that used Kleros Court to moderate group chats. Community members could flag messages as violations of group rules, and Kleros jurors would vote on whether the flagged content should be removed and the poster penalized.

The bot demonstrated an early use case for decentralized content moderation, where moderation decisions were made by a crowd of jurors rather than a single administrator.

## Why It Was Retired

- Limited adoption beyond experimental use
- Telegram API limitations constrained the feature set
- Development resources redirected to core products (Court V2, Curate, Escrow)
