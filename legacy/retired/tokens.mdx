# Tokens (Retired)

<Warning>
The Tokens interface has been retired. Token registry functionality is now part of [Curate](/products/curate).
</Warning>

**Kleros Tokens** (also known as the Token² Curated Registry or T2CR) was a standalone web interface for submitting tokens to the Kleros Token Registry. It allowed anyone to submit token information (name, ticker, address, logo) for community curation, with incorrect submissions challengeable through Kleros Court.

## Current Replacement

Token registry functionality now lives within [Kleros Curate](/products/curate), which provides a more flexible and general-purpose framework for creating any type of curated registry — including token lists, address tags, and more. Token data curated through Curate is displayed in [Kleros Scout](/products/scout).
