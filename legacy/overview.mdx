## Migration to V2

If you are running an existing V1 integration, see the [Migration Guide](/legacy/migration-guide) for steps to upgrade to V2.

Key V2 advantages over V1:

- Deployed on Arbitrum with significantly lower gas costs
- Modular dispute kit architecture
- Cross-chain support via VEA bridge
- Simplified integration (evidence and appeals handled by the Court, not the arbitrable)
- Enhanced vote privacy (Shutter integration in development)

For migration support, contact the team at **integrations@kleros.io**.
