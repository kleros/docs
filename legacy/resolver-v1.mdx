# Resolver V1 (Legacy)

<Warning>
Resolver V1 was a standalone application. Its functionality is now integrated directly into the [Court V2](/court/overview) interface.
</Warning>

Kleros Dispute Resolver V1 (formerly known as "Resolve") was a standalone web application that allowed users to create arbitrary disputes in Kleros Court without needing to build a custom arbitrable contract. Users could define the dispute question, options, and evidence, then submit it directly to Court for resolution.

## What It Did

- Allowed anyone to create a dispute from a web interface
- No smart contract development required
- Used for simple two-party disagreements
- Evidence submission and appeal management through the Resolver UI

---

## Current Status

In V2, the ability to create disputes directly has been integrated into the Court interface at [court.kleros.io](https://court.kleros.io). There is no longer a separate Resolver application — users can create disputes and submit evidence directly within the Court UI.
