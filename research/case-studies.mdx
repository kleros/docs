## Kleros V2 Beta: Case #0

The very first dispute on Kleros V2 (on Arbitrum) was a **Kleros Enterprise Consumer Dispute for Lemon**, a leading Argentine fintech serving over 2 million users. This case was created during the V2 beta launch in November 2024, marking the transition from testnet to live disputes on Arbitrum.

## Curated List Disputes

The majority of Kleros disputes historically have involved **Token Curated Registries (TCRs)** — challenges to submissions in curated lists. The "Doges on Trial" pilot in 2018 was the first live test, where participants submitted and challenged meme images to a curated registry.

Since then, TCR disputes have evolved to cover real-world use cases: token registry submissions, address tag accuracy challenges, and CDN content disputes through [Scout](/products/scout) and [Curate](/products/curate).

## E-Commerce and Escrow Disputes

Kleros Escrow has resolved disputes between buyers and sellers over digital services, freelance work, and physical goods. These cases typically involve evidence such as screenshots of deliverables, communication records, and agreed-upon terms.

## Governance Disputes (Zodiac/SafeSnap)

Through the [Reality.eth + Kleros](/products/reality) integration, Kleros has served as the arbitration backstop for DAO governance execution. When a Snapshot proposal outcome is challenged on Reality.eth, Kleros jurors determine whether the proposed transactions match the governance vote.
