# Kleros Products

Kleros provides a suite of decentralized applications, all powered by Kleros Court for dispute resolution. This page gives an overview of each product and its current protocol version.
<img src="/images/overviewv2-hero.png" alt="Kleros Interface" />

<Note>
  **Kleros V2** is the latest version of the Kleros protocol, featuring improved scalability, lower gas costs, and enhanced dispute resolution mechanics. Most products have migrated or are migrating to V2.

## Protocol Version Guide

| Product | Protocol Version | Status |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| [Court](/court/overview) | **V2** | ✅ Live |
| [Curate](/products/curate) | **V2** | ✅ Live |
| [Escrow](/products/escrow) | **V2** | ✅ Live |
| [Governor](/products/governor) | **V2** | ✅ Live |
| [Scout](/products/scout) | V1 | 🔄 V2 coming soon |
| [Reality (Oracle)](/products/reality) | V1 | 🔄 V2 coming soon |
| [Proof of Humanity](/products/proof-of-humanity) | V1 | ⚠️ See note below |

<Warning>
  **Proof of Humanity note:** PoH has its own "V2" product upgrade (cross-chain support, improved UX), but it still uses the **Kleros V1 protocol** for dispute resolution. Don't confuse "PoH 2.0" (the product) with "Kleros V2" (the protocol).
</Warning>

## Choosing Between V1 and V2

**For new integrations:** Always use V2 products when available. V2 offers:
- Lower gas costs
- Improved dispute resolution mechanics
- Better scalability
- Active development and support

**For existing V1 integrations:** See the [Migration Guide](/legacy/migration-guide) for steps to upgrade.

**For V1-only products (Scout, Reality, PoH):** Continue using V1 for now. Migration guides will be provided when V2 support is available.
