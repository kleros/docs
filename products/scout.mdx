# Scout

<img src="/images/scout-hero.png" alt="Kleros Scout Interface" />
<Note>Scout currently uses **V1 Curate registries**. Scout V2 redesign (frontend) is complete, with underlying registry migration to V2 planned.</Note>

**Kleros Scout** is a frontend application that displays community-curated safety and metadata information for smart contracts, tokens, and dApps. It aggregates data from multiple [Curate](/products/curate) registries to give users a unified view of address tags, contract labels, and token information.

Scout is the public-facing layer on top of Curate's decentralized registries — think of it as a read-only explorer that makes registry data accessible to wallets, block explorers, and end users.

## How Scout Works

Scout itself does not manage submissions or disputes — those happen in [Curate](/products/curate). Scout reads from four main Curate registries:

**Address Tags Registry (ATR)** — Maps contract addresses to human-readable labels (e.g., "Uniswap V3 Router"). These tags appear in block explorers like Blockscout and wallet interfaces like MetaMask.

**Address Tags Query (ATQ)** — Handles removal requests and quality checks for the ATR.

**Token Registry** — Curated list of verified ERC-20 tokens with metadata (name, symbol, logo, decimals).

**CDN Registry** — Stores additional metadata like project logos and descriptions served to dApps.

### Integrations

Scout data powers labels and safety information in several major products:

- **Blockscout** — Address labels from Scout registries
- **MetaMask Snaps** — Contract verification data
- **Otterscan** — Contract tags
- **Uniswap, Zerion** — Token metadata

## Earning Rewards Through Curation

Kleros runs active incentive programs for Scout registry contributors. Curators earn PNK rewards for submitting accurate address tags and successfully challenging incorrect ones.

Current incentive details (updated monthly via blog posts):

- Submission and removal reward pools are distributed proportionally among successful participants
- Specific chains are eligible for rewards each month
- ERC-20, ERC-721, and EIP-1167 contract submissions may have different reward eligibility rules
