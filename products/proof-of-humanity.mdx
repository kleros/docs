# Proof of Humanity

<Warning>
Proof of Humanity uses the **Kleros V1 protocol** for dispute resolution — even the "PoH 2.0" product version. The "2.0" refers to product improvements (cross-chain support, improved UX), not the underlying Kleros arbitration protocol version.
</Warning>

**Proof of Humanity (PoH)** is a Sybil-resistant registry of verified humans. It combines video verification, social vouching, and Kleros dispute resolution to create a decentralized identity system where each registered person is cryptographically linked to a unique Ethereum address.

PoH serves as the foundation for applications that need to distinguish real humans from bots and duplicate accounts — enabling fairer airdrops, one-person-one-vote governance, and universal basic income distribution.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit a Profile">
    Register by submitting a video of yourself holding your Ethereum address, along with a name and photo. A deposit is required to deter spam.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Vouched">
    An already-registered human must vouch for you. Vouching is a web-of-trust mechanism: the voucher stakes their reputation on your legitimacy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Challenge Period">
    Your submission enters a challenge period. Anyone can challenge your registration (e.g., claiming you're a duplicate or the video doesn't meet requirements) by paying a challenge deposit. Challenges are resolved by Kleros Court.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Registration">
    If unchallenged (or if you win the dispute), you're registered as a verified human. Registration has an expiration period after which you must re-verify.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## PoH 2.0 (Product Update)

The PoH 2.0 product update introduced several improvements to the registration experience:

**Cross-chain profiles** — Profiles can exist on multiple chains (Ethereum, Gnosis Chain), enabling use across different ecosystems.

**Improved UX** — Simplified registration flow, better video guidance, and clearer status tracking.

**Enhanced vouching** — Refined vouching mechanics to strengthen the web-of-trust.

<Note>
These are product-level improvements. The underlying dispute resolution still uses Kleros V1 contracts on Ethereum mainnet.
</Note>

## Use Cases

**Sybil-Resistant Governance** — PoH-gated voting ensures one person = one vote, preventing token-whale domination. The Kleros yellow paper describes a future court mode where juror selection requires PoH registration.

**Universal Basic Income** — The UBI token project distributes a universal basic income stream to every registered PoH human.

**Fair Airdrops** — Projects can use PoH to ensure airdrop tokens go to unique humans rather than bots farming with multiple wallets.

**Identity Verification** — Any application that needs to verify a user is a unique human without relying on centralized KYC providers.
