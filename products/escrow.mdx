# Escrow

<Note>
**V2** - Looking for V1 documentation? See [Escrow V1 (Legacy)](/legacy/escrow-v1).
</Note>

**Kleros Escrow** is a decentralized escrow platform that secures blockchain transactions between untrusted parties. It combines smart contract automation with Kleros' decentralized arbitration system to provide trustless transaction security for digital commerce.

Traditional online transactions require trust between strangers, creating opportunities for fraud and disputes. Kleros Escrow eliminates this trust requirement by securing funds in smart contracts, allowing structured settlement negotiations, and delivering decentralized arbitration through Kleros Court when agreements fail.

## How It Works

<Steps>

</Step>

  Seller provides agreed service/product before the specified deadline.
</Step>

<Step title="Resolution">
  Transaction concludes through payment, settlement, manual deadline execution, or arbitration.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Resolution Mechanisms

Kleros Escrow V2 provides multiple ways to resolve transactions:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Direct Payment">
    **When parties fully agree**

    - **Full Payment**: Buyer releases entire amount to seller when satisfied
    - **Full Refund**: Seller returns entire amount to buyer if unable to deliver
    - **Partial Transactions**: Either party can process partial amounts for completed portions
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Settlement">
    **When parties partially disagree**

    The structured negotiation process:

    1. **Proposal**: Either party proposes a settlement amount
    2. **Counter-Proposal**: Other party can propose a different amount
    3. **Agreement**: When one party accepts, funds distribute automatically
    4. **Escalation**: If no agreement after timeout, either party can raise a dispute

    <Warning>
    Proposing a settlement does NOT transfer funds. Money only moves when one party explicitly accepts the other party's proposal.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Deadline Execution">
    **When deadline passes**

    After the deadline, anyone can trigger execution to transfer remaining funds to the seller if:
    - No active disputes exist
    - No settlement negotiations are pending
    - The deadline has elapsed

    <Info>
    This requires a manual transaction call—it is NOT automatic. Any address can trigger it once conditions are met.
    </Info>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Dispute Resolution">
    **When settlement fails**

    1. **Fee Payment**: Both parties pay arbitration fees within timeout
    2. **Evidence Submission**: Parties submit supporting evidence
    3. **Jury Selection**: Kleros randomly selects impartial jurors
    4. **Ruling**: Jury decides outcome based on evidence
    5. **Enforcement**: Smart contract automatically executes ruling

    Arbitration fees are reimbursed to the winning party. If one party fails to pay fees within the timeout, the paying party wins automatically.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
