## What is Kleros V2?

Kleros is a decentralized dispute resolution protocol. Think of it as a **court system for smart contracts** — when parties disagree, Kleros provides a trustless way to reach an enforceable ruling.

**V2** brings major upgrades: cross-chain support, modular dispute resolution, and improved scalability by operating on Arbitrum.

## Why Integrate?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Trustless Enforcement" icon="gavel">
    No central authority. Rulings are cryptoeconomically secured by staked jurors.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flexible Resolution" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Binary yes/no, multiple choice, or nuanced rulings — your contract defines the options.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cross-Chain Ready" icon="link">
    Disputes can originate from Ethereum mainnet or other chains via the gateway system.

## Use Cases

| Application | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| **Escrow** | Release funds only when both parties agree, or let jurors decide |
| **Insurance** | Decentralized claims processing |
| **Curation** | Token-curated registries with dispute resolution |
| **Oracles** | Human-powered verification for subjective data |
| **DAOs** | Governance dispute resolution |

## How It Works (30-second version)

```
Your Contract → Creates Dispute → Jurors Vote → Ruling Returned → Your Contract Enforces
```

1. Your contract implements `IArbitrableV2` interface
2. When a dispute arises, call `createDispute()` with arbitration fees
3. Random jurors are drawn (weighted by staked PNK)
4. Jurors vote, with appeals possible
5. Final ruling is passed back to your contract via `rule()`

## Network & Status

<Note>
**Kleros V2 is live on Arbitrum One** (mainnet). The court system is operational and processing disputes.
</Note>

| Network | Chain ID | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Arbitrum One | 42161 | ✅ Live |
| Ethereum Mainnet | 1 | Gateway only (disputes bridge to Arbitrum) |
