## Introduction

Kleros Oracle combines [Reality.eth](https://reality.eth.limo/) — a bond escalation mechanism for crowdsourced answers — with Kleros Court as an external arbitrator. This provides a decentralized oracle that can answer any question with a publicly verifiable answer.

Your application only interacts with Reality.eth. Kleros is invoked automatically when a dispute over an answer is escalated to arbitration.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ask a Question">
    Your contract (or a user) submits a question to Reality.eth with a minimum bond and references a Kleros arbitrator proxy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Answer with Bonds">
    Anyone can submit an answer by posting a bond. To override an existing answer, the new answerer must post a bond at least double the previous one. This bond escalation mechanism economically discourages incorrect answers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Finalization or Arbitration">
    If no one challenges the current answer within the timeout period, it finalizes. If a dispute arises, anyone can request arbitration through the Kleros Arbitrator Proxy, which creates a case in Kleros Court.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ruling">
    Kleros jurors evaluate the question and evidence, then submit a ruling. The arbitrator proxy reports the ruling back to Reality.eth, which finalizes the answer accordingly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Architecture

The integration uses three contract layers:

| Contract | Chain | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Your Contract** | Any supported chain | Asks questions, reads finalized answers |
| **Reality.eth** | Same chain as your contract | Bond escalation, answer management, timeout logic |
| **Kleros Arbitrator Proxy** | Same chain as Reality.eth | Creates disputes in Kleros Court, reports rulings back |

Your contract only interacts with Reality.eth. The arbitrator proxy is specified when asking the question, and the proxy handles all interaction with Kleros Court.

## Supported Chains

Reality.eth is deployed on multiple chains. Kleros arbitrator proxies are available on:

| Chain | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Ethereum Mainnet | Active (V1 Court) |
| Gnosis Chain | Active (V1 Court) |
| Arbitrum One | Available via V2 Court |
| Polygon | Active (V1 Court) |

<Note>
  Check the [Reality.eth deployment repository](https://github.com/RealityETH/reality-eth-monorepo/tree/main/packages/contracts/chains/deployments) for the full list of chain deployments and contract addresses.

## Question Types

Reality.eth supports several question templates:

| Template ID | Type | Answer Format | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `bool` | Yes/No | "Did event X happen?" |
| 1 | `uint` | Numeric value | "What was the price of ETH on date Y?" |
| 2 | `single-select` | One of N options | "Which team won?" |
| 3 | `multiple-select` | Subset of N options | "Which proposals passed?" |
| 4 | `datetime` | Unix timestamp | "When did event X occur?" |

Custom templates can be registered for specific use cases.

## Key Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bond Escalation">
    Each successive answer must post at least double the previous bond. This makes incorrect answers increasingly expensive to sustain, causing most questions to resolve correctly without arbitration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Arbitration Escalation">
    At any point after a first answer is submitted, anyone can request arbitration by paying the arbitration fee. The Kleros Arbitrator Proxy creates a dispute in the configured court and subcourt.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Evidence Submission">
    Evidence for arbitration is submitted through the Kleros Arbitrator Proxy contract, not through Reality.eth. The proxy manages the evidence group and forwards it to Kleros Court.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Configurable Parameters">
    Each arbitrator proxy is deployed with a specific subcourt and initial number of juror votes. The Kleros team can deploy custom proxies for specific use cases.
  </Accordion>
