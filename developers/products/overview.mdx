title: "Building on Kleros Products"
description: "Integrate with Kleros products to add dispute resolution, curation, identity verification, and oracle capabilities to your application."

## Overview

Kleros provides a suite of products built on top of Kleros Court V2. Each product implements the arbitration standard and can be integrated into third-party applications through smart contract calls, subgraph queries, or frontend SDKs.

All products use Kleros Court on Arbitrum One as the arbitration backend. Disputes raised through any product follow the same resolution flow: juror drawing, evidence submission, voting, appeal, and ruling enforcement.

## Integration Approaches

Kleros products can be integrated in two ways:

**Direct smart contract integration** — Your contract calls the product's contract functions directly. This is the recommended path for on-chain applications that need trustless dispute resolution or curation.

**Recognition of jurisdiction** — Your platform uses Kleros products through an off-chain agreement, where the dispute is escalated to Kleros Court and the ruling is enforced by your platform's own mechanisms. This is suitable when full smart contract integration is not yet feasible.

For both approaches, refer to the individual product guides for contract addresses, interface specifications, and working code examples.

## Shared Infrastructure

All Kleros V2 products share these components:

| Component | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **KlerosCore** | Central arbitrator contract on Arbitrum One |
| **SortitionModule** | Stake-weighted random juror selection |
| **DisputeKitClassic** | Default voting and appeal logic |
| **DisputeTemplateRegistry** | Stores dispute display metadata for Court UI |
| **Vea** | Cross-chain message bridge for relaying disputes and rulings |
