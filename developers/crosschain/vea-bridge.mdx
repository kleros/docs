title: "Vea Bridge"
description: "Cross-chain message bridge enabling faster and cheaper communication between Kleros Court on Arbitrum and arbitrable contracts on other chains."
---

## Overview

Vea is a general-purpose cross-chain message bridge developed by Kleros. It enables faster bridging than native rollup bridges by using a trust-minimized fraud-proof game. In the Kleros protocol, Vea handles two critical message types:

- **Dispute creation** — Arbitrable contracts on foreign chains send dispute requests to Kleros Court on Arbitrum (Foreign → Home)
- **Ruling relay** — Kleros Court sends finalized rulings back to arbitrable contracts on foreign chains (Home → Foreign)

Vea is the bridge layer that connects the [Foreign Gateway](/developers/crosschain/l2-integration) and [Home Gateway](/developers/architecture) contracts.

## Architecture

Vea uses different bridge primitives depending on the message direction and security requirements:

| Bridge Type | Direction | Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Simple Bridge** | Foreign → Home (dispute creation) | Direct relay via gateways. No fraud-proof game because a malicious dispute only wastes the attacker's gas. |
| **Fast Bridge** | Home → Foreign (ruling relay) | Trust-minimized bridge with deposit-backed claims and a challenge period. Falls back to native bridge only when a claim is challenged. |
| **Safe Bridge** | Fallback | Thin wrapper around the native rollup bridge (e.g., Arbitrum → Ethereum). Used when Fast Bridge claims are challenged. |

### Fast Bridge Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Court as Kleros Court (Arbitrum)
    participant HG as Home Gateway
    participant VI as VeaInbox (Home)
    participant Bridger
    participant VO as VeaOutbox (Foreign)
    participant FG as Foreign Gateway
    participant App as Arbitrable (Foreign)

    Court->>HG: rule(disputeID, ruling)
    HG->>VI: sendMessage(ruling data)
    Bridger->>VO: claim(messageHash, deposit)
    Note over VO: Challenge period starts
    alt No challenge (happy path)
        VO->>FG: verifyAndRelay(message)
        FG->>App: rule(disputeID, ruling)
    else Challenged (unhappy path)
        Note over VO: Falls back to native bridge
        VO->>FG: relayViaNativeBridge(message)
        FG->>App: rule(disputeID, ruling)
    end
```

## Participants

| Role | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Bridger** | Actively relays messages from the home chain by making deposit-backed claims on the foreign chain. Only one honest bridger is required. |
| **Challenger** | Monitors claims on the foreign chain. Submits a challenge only when witnessing a dishonest claim. Does not propose a correct answer — the correct message comes from the native bridge. |
| **Relayer** | Verifies that the challenge period has passed without challenge, then calls `verifyAndRelay()` to deliver the message. |

### Incentive Structure

- If the Challenger wins, they earn the Bridger's deposit
- If the Bridger wins, they earn the Challenger's deposit
- The loser forfeits their deposit

## Supported Routes

| Route | Direction | Bridge Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Arbitrum → Ethereum | Home → Foreign | Fast Bridge |
| Ethereum → Arbitrum | Foreign → Home | Simple Bridge |
| Arbitrum → Gnosis Chain | Home → Foreign | Fast Bridge (multi-hop: Arbitrum → Ethereum → Gnosis via two Safe Bridges in unhappy path) |

<Note>
  Vea does not rely on a direct native bridge between Arbitrum and Gnosis Chain. In the unhappy path, challenged claims are resolved using two Safe Bridges: Arbitrum → Ethereum Mainnet, then Ethereum Mainnet → Gnosis Chain.

## Contract Components

### VeaInbox (Home Chain — Arbitrum)

Deployed on the home chain. Accepts outgoing messages from the Home Gateway and batches them for bridging.

```solidity
/// @dev Send a message to the foreign chain.
function sendMessage(address _to, bytes4 _fnSelector, bytes memory _data) external;
```

### VeaOutbox (Foreign Chain)

Deployed on each foreign chain. Receives claims from bridgers and manages the challenge period.

```solidity
/// @dev Make a claim about a message hash with a deposit.
function claim(bytes32 _messageHash) external payable;

/// @dev Challenge a pending claim.
function challenge(bytes32 _messageHash) external payable;

/// @dev Verify and relay a message after the challenge period.
function verifyAndRelay(bytes memory _message) external;
```
