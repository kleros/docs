title: "V1 Overview"
description: "Overview of Kleros Court V1 architecture, contracts, and deployment status."
---

## Status

Kleros Court V1 is deployed on Ethereum Mainnet, Gnosis Chain, and Polygon. It remains operational for existing integrations. New integrations should use [Kleros V2 on Arbitrum One](/developers/overview).

---

## Architecture

V1 uses a single `KlerosLiquid` contract that combines arbitration, staking, juror drawing, voting, and appeal logic:

| Contract | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **KlerosLiquid** | Core court contract handling disputes, juror selection, and ruling enforcement |
| **PNK** | ERC-20 token used for staking and juror incentives |
| **PolicyRegistry** | Stores court policies describing juror guidelines |
| **Arbitrable Contracts** | Implement ERC-792 to interact with KlerosLiquid |

### V1 vs V2 Differences

| Feature | V1 | V2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Home chain | Ethereum Mainnet | Arbitrum One |
| Arbitration standard | ERC-792 | IArbitratorV2 (no appeal in interface) |
| Evidence standard | ERC-1497 | Dispute Templates + cross-chain evidence |
| Dispute kits | None (monolithic) | Modular (DisputeKitClassic, specialized kits) |
| Voting | Commit-reveal | Shutter-encrypted single-transaction |
| Cross-chain | Limited (xDAI bridge) | Vea bridge (Ethereum, Gnosis, extensible) |
| Staking | Direct in KlerosLiquid | SortitionModule (sortition tree) |

## V1 Standards

V1 integrations use two ERC standards:

- **[ERC-792](/developers/legacy/erc-792)** — Arbitration Standard defining the `IArbitrable` and `IArbitrator` interfaces
- **[ERC-1497](/developers/legacy/erc-1497)** — Evidence Standard defining `MetaEvidence`, `Evidence`, and `Dispute` events for sharing dispute context

## Migration

If you have an existing V1 integration and want to migrate to V2, see the [Migration Guide](/developers/legacy/migrating-to-v2).
