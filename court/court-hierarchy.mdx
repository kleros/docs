# Court Hierarchy

Kleros courts are organized in a hierarchical tree structure, allowing disputes to be handled by jurors with appropriate expertise while maintaining a clear appeals path.

## Court Structure

## Court Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="General Court">
    **The Root Court (ID: 1)**

    - Currently serves as the root of the court system
    - Handles appeals from all specialized courts
    - Has the broadest juror requirements
    - Includes every juror in the system (due to automatic parent staking)

    <Info>
    When you stake in any specialized court, you are automatically staked in all parent courts up to the General Court.
    </Info>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Specialized Courts">
    **Domain-Specific Expertise**

    - Focus on specific domains (blockchain technical, English language, art curation, etc.)
    - Require specific expertise from jurors
    - Allow for more specialized resolution of complex disputes
    - Have their own policy documents defining rules and requirements

    **Examples:**
    - **Blockchain Technical**: Smart contract disputes, technical implementations
    - **Curation**: Token lists, address tags, registry disputes
    - **English Language**: Translation quality, content disputes
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Forking Court">
    **Reserved for Future Use (ID: 0)**

    - Reserved for protocol-level disputes
    - Will handle fundamental governance decisions
    - Will serve as the ultimate escalation point
    - Currently cannot be used

    <Warning>
    Court ID 0 is reserved and cannot be used for regular disputes.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Automated Curation">
    **AI-Optimized Resolution**

    - New court type designed for AI agents
    - Optimized dispute resolution parameters
    - Suitable for high-volume, lower-stakes curation tasks
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Court Parameters

Each court has specific parameters that define how it operates:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Minimum Stake** | Minimum PNK required to participate | 2,300 PNK |
| **Alpha** | Controls how much PNK is locked per vote (basis points) | 10000 (100%) |
| **Fee For Juror** | Payment per juror per case | 0.05 ETH |
| **Jurors For Court Jump** | Threshold that triggers escalation to parent court | 511 jurors |
| **Hidden Votes** | Whether commit-reveal voting is used | true/false |
| **Time Per Period** | Duration of each dispute phase | Varies |

### Understanding Alpha

The `alpha` parameter determines how much of your stake is locked when drawn as a juror:

```
pnkAtStakePerJuror = (minStake × alpha) / 10000
```

<Accordion title="Alpha Example">
**With minStake = 2,300 PNK and alpha = 10000 (100%)**

Your locked amount per vote = 2,300 PNK

If alpha were 5000 (50%), your locked amount would be 1,150 PNK per vote.
</Accordion>

### Time Periods

Each dispute progresses through four key periods:

1. **Evidence Period**: Time for parties to submit evidence
2. **Commit Period**: Time for jurors to commit votes (if hidden votes = true)
3. **Vote Period**: Time for voting or revealing votes
4. **Appeal Period**: Time to fund appeals

<Info>
Periods can now end early when no more interactions are needed, speeding up dispute resolution.

## Automatic Parent Staking

<Warning>
**Critical Concept**: When you stake in a specialized court, you are automatically staked in all parent courts up to the General Court.
</Warning>

**What this means:**

- Staking in the Blockchain court = also eligible for General Court cases
- Staking in the Solidity sub-court = eligible for Blockchain AND General Court cases
- The General Court includes every juror in the entire system

**Why this matters:**

- You may be drawn for cases in any parent court
- Ensures sufficient juror availability at each level
- Maintains a proper appeals path

---

## Court Policies

Each court has a policy document that defines:

| Section | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | What types of disputes the court handles |
| **Rules** | Guidelines jurors must follow when evaluating evidence |
| **Required Skills** | Knowledge or expertise jurors should possess |
| **Special Procedures** | Any court-specific requirements |

<Warning>
**Critical for Jurors**: Always read the court policy before staking or voting! Failing to follow court policies might result in incoherent votes and lost PNK.
</Warning>

## Multi-Court Staking

You can stake in multiple courts, but there are important considerations:

### Court Limit

- Maximum of **4 courts** per juror
- This is a technical limitation for gas efficiency
- Plan your court selection strategically

### PNK Distribution

- Your total staked PNK is distributed across the court path
- The UI simplifies this by showing your stake for each court
- Parent courts automatically include your stake from child courts

### Choosing Courts

Consider these factors when selecting courts:

1. **Your Expertise**: Match courts to your knowledge areas
2. **Minimum Stake**: Ensure you meet requirements
3. **Activity Level**: More active courts = more earning opportunities
4. **Policy Alignment**: Understand and agree with court rules
