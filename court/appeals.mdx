# Appeals

The appeals system is a core feature of Kleros Court that ensures fairness and allows for error correction. Any party—or even third parties—can challenge a ruling by funding an appeal.

---

## How Appeals Work

<Steps>

<Step title="Initial Ruling">
  After jurors vote, a preliminary ruling is reached based on majority decision. This ruling enters the **Appeal Period**.
</Step>

<Step title="Appeal Funding">
  During the appeal period, anyone can fund an appeal:
  - **Challenger**: Funds to overturn the ruling (2× appeal cost)
  - **Winner**: Funds to defend the ruling (1× appeal cost)
</Step>

<Step title="Counter-Funding">
  If one side funds, the other side has the opportunity to counter-fund. If only one side funds fully, that side wins by default.
</Step>

<Step title="New Round">
  If both sides fund, a new round begins with more jurors. The process repeats until appeals are exhausted or unfunded.
</Step>

<Step title="Final Ruling">
  When no more appeals are funded (or the appeal period expires), the current ruling becomes final and is executed.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Appeal Funding Requirements

The appeal system uses asymmetric funding to create proper incentives:

| Side | Funding Required | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Challenging Side** | 2× appeal cost | Higher barrier discourages frivolous appeals |
| **Winning Side** | 1× appeal cost | Lower cost to defend legitimate rulings |

### Calculating Appeal Cost

```
appealCost = feeForJuror × ((currentJurors × 2) + 1)
```

<Accordion title="Appeal Cost Example">
**Scenario:** Current round has 3 jurors at 0.05 ETH each.

Next round will have: (3 × 2) + 1 = **7 jurors**

**Appeal costs:**
- Challenger: 0.05 ETH × 7 × 2 = **0.70 ETH**
- Winner: 0.05 ETH × 7 × 1 = **0.35 ETH**
</Accordion>

## Funding Deadlines

<Warning>
Timing is critical for appeals. Miss the deadline and your opportunity is lost.
</Warning>

| Party | Deadline |
| --- | --- |
| **Challenger** | First half of appeal period only |
| **Winner** | Entire appeal period |

This asymmetry creates urgency for challengers while giving winners adequate time to respond.

---

## Juror Progression

With each appeal round, the number of jurors increases:

```
Round 1:  3 jurors
Round 2:  7 jurors    (3×2 + 1)
Round 3:  15 jurors   (7×2 + 1)
Round 4:  31 jurors   (15×2 + 1)
Round 5:  63 jurors   (31×2 + 1)
...
```

This exponential growth ensures that:
- Important cases receive thorough review
- The cost of repeated appeals increases substantially
- Eventually, a large enough jury reaches a stable consensus

---

## Court Jumps

When the number of jurors exceeds a threshold, the dispute "jumps" to a parent court:

### How Court Jumps Work

<Steps>

<Step title="Threshold Reached">
  The dispute requires more jurors than the `jurorsForCourtJump` parameter (e.g., 511 jurors).
</Step>

<Step title="Escalation">
  The dispute automatically moves to the parent court in the hierarchy.
</Step>

<Step title="New Parameters">
  The dispute adopts the parent court's parameters and juror pool.
</Step>

<Step title="Continued Resolution">
  Jurors from the broader parent court now handle the case.
</Step>

</Steps>

### V2 Enhancements

Kleros V2 introduces significant improvements to court jumps:

<Card title="Dispute Kit Jumps" icon="puzzle-piece">
  If a parent court doesn't support the current dispute kit, the dispute can switch to a compatible kit—including complex question types.
</Card>

<Card title="Dynamic Juror Adjustment" icon="sliders">
  Juror numbers adjust dynamically based on the new court's parameters and dispute kit requirements.
</Card>

</CardGroup>

<Info>
These jumps ensure that complex or contentious cases receive appropriate handling by a broader, less specialized jury.

## Appeal Rewards

Successfully funding appeals can be profitable:

### If Your Side Wins

When you fund the winning side of an appeal:

- Your funding is returned
- You receive a portion of the losing side's funding as profit
- Rewards are proportional to your contribution

### If Your Side Loses

- Your funding is forfeited
- It's distributed to the winning side's funders

<Tip>
Appeal funding is a form of crowdfunding justice. Multiple contributors can fund a side together, sharing in the rewards or losses proportionally.
</Tip>

## Strategic Considerations

### For Disputants

- **Evaluate Strength**: Only appeal if you have strong evidence the ruling was wrong
- **Consider Costs**: Each round is more expensive than the last
- **Time Your Funding**: Challengers must act in the first half of the appeal period

### For Third-Party Funders

- **Review Evidence**: Study the case before funding either side
- **Assess Probability**: Consider how likely the ruling is to change
- **Diversify Risk**: Fund multiple appeals to spread risk

### For Jurors

- **Expect Appeals**: Large-stake disputes often get appealed
- **Court Jumps**: You may be drawn for cases that jumped from sub-courts
- **Increased Complexity**: Appealed cases are often more contentious
