# How Kleros Court Works

Kleros Court resolves disputes through a structured process that ensures fairness, transparency, and economic alignment. This page walks through each stage from dispute creation to final execution.

---

## The Dispute Lifecycle

<Steps>

<Step title="Dispute Creation">
  An arbitrable application encounters a contentious situation and needs resolution.

  - The application creates a dispute in Kleros, providing case details
  - Arbitration fees are paid to incentivize jurors (the protocol takes no commission)
  - Court selection is specified through the `extraData` parameter
  - The dispute enters the **Evidence Period**
</Step>

<Step title="Evidence Period">
  Both parties submit evidence to support their case.

  - Evidence can include text explanations, documents, images, or other materials
  - All evidence is stored permanently and transparently on-chain
  - Deposit requirements prevent spam submissions
  - The dispute template defines what information is needed
</Step>

<Step title="Juror Selection">
  Jurors are randomly drawn from those who have staked PNK in the relevant court.

  - Selection probability is proportional to the amount of PNK staked
  - The Sortition Module uses a three-phase system to prevent manipulation
  - Selected jurors receive notification of their drawing
  - A portion of each juror's stake is locked as collateral
  - All required jurors must be drawn before proceeding
</Step>

<Step title="Voting Period">
  Jurors review evidence and cast their votes.

  **Current Implementation (Commit-Reveal):**
  - Jurors commit a hash of their vote during the Commit Period
  - Votes remain hidden until the Reveal Period
  - Jurors must return to reveal their vote with justification
  - Failure to reveal results in stake loss

  **Coming Soon (Shutter Integration):**
  - Single-transaction encrypted voting
  - Automatic decryption via threshold cryptography
  - No manual reveal required
</Step>

<Step title="Appeal Period">
  Parties can challenge the outcome if dissatisfied.

  - Anyone can fund an appeal to support a particular side
  - The opposing side can counter-fund to defend the original outcome
  - Appeals increase the number of jurors (typically doubling plus one)
  - Large or contentious cases may jump to a parent court
</Step>

<Step title="Execution">
  Once appeals are exhausted, the ruling becomes final.

  - The arbitrator contract calls back the original application
  - Coherent jurors (who voted with the majority) receive rewards
  - Incoherent jurors lose a portion of their staked PNK
  - The ruling is enforced automatically by the smart contract
</Step>

</Steps>

## The Phase System

The Sortition Module uses a three-phase cycle to prevent manipulation of juror selection:

```
┌─────────────┐          ┌─────────────┐          ┌─────────────┐
│             │          │             │          │             │
│   Staking   │──────────▶  Generating │──────────▶   Drawing   │
│             │          │             │          │             │
└─────────────┘          └─────────────┘          └─────────────┘
       ▲                                                 │
       │                                                 │
       └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Staking Phase">
    **Best time to adjust your stakes**

    - Stake changes take effect immediately
    - Jurors can update their stakes in various courts
    - Duration varies based on dispute activity
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Generating Phase">
    **Random number being generated**

    - A random number is requested and becomes visible on-chain
    - Stake changes are recorded but won't apply until next Staking phase
    - Duration depends on the randomness source
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Drawing Phase">
    **Jurors being selected**

    - Jurors are drawn using the random number and current stake distribution
    - Stake changes remain delayed
    - Continues until all disputes have jurors or maximum time elapses
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
If you stake during Generating or Drawing phases, your changes won't affect current selection chances. The Court UI shows whether your stakes are "Current" or "Delayed."
</Warning>

## Dispute Kits

Kleros V2 introduces modular dispute resolution through pluggable Dispute Kits:

| Kit | Description | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Classic** | Traditional majority voting where the option with most votes wins | Standard disputes |
| **Ranked Choice** | Jurors rank multiple options by preference | Nuanced multi-option decisions |
| **Complex Question** | Advanced mechanisms for sophisticated decision-making | Multi-faceted disputes |
| **Shutter-Enabled** | Threshold encryption for enhanced vote privacy | Privacy-sensitive cases |
| **PoH-Gated** | Requires Proof of Humanity verification | Sybil-resistant voting |

Each court is compatible with specific dispute kits. When creating disputes, arbitrables can select desired features rather than specific kits, simplifying integration.

## Voting Mechanics

### Current: Commit-Reveal

<Steps>
<Step title="Commit Phase">
  Choose your vote, generate a salt, and submit your commitment transaction. Keep your vote secret and remember your salt.
</Step>

<Step title="Reveal Phase">
  Return to reveal your vote with justification. Failure to reveal means losing your locked PNK.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Future: Shutter Encrypted Voting

<Note>
Shutter Network integration is completed on testnet and currently resolving implementation issues before production deployment.
</Note>

- Single-transaction private voting
- Votes encrypted using threshold cryptography
- Automatic decryption at the appropriate time
- No manual reveal required
- Prevention of vote copying and bandwagon effects

## Rewards and Penalties

### For Coherent Jurors (voted with majority)

You receive rewards from two sources:

1. **Arbitration Fees**: ETH or whitelisted ERC20 tokens paid by dispute creators, divided among coherent jurors
2. **PNK Redistribution**: Penalties from incoherent jurors, divided among coherent jurors

**Reward Formula:**
```
jurorReward = (totalFees / numberOfCoherentVotes) × degreeOfCoherence
pnkReward = (totalPenalties / numberOfCoherentVotes) × degreeOfCoherence
```

### For Incoherent Jurors (voted against majority)

- Lose a portion of staked PNK (determined by the `alpha` parameter)
- Forfeit arbitration fee rewards

<Accordion title="Reward Example">
**Scenario:** Case has 5 jurors with 0.05 ETH fee per juror (total: 0.25 ETH). 3 jurors vote coherently, 2 incoherently.

**Each coherent juror receives:**
- ETH: 0.25 ÷ 3 = ~0.083 ETH
- PNK: (2 × locked PNK amount) ÷ 3
</Accordion>

## Staking Rewards (KIP-66)

<Info>
Staking rewards are fully implemented in the smart contracts and will be enabled once V2 officially exits beta. This community-approved governance proposal provides additional incentives separate from traditional arbitration fees.
</Info>

## Security Features

### Enhanced RNG System

The random number generation system includes comprehensive fallback mechanisms:

- **Primary**: Chainlink-based random number generation
- **Fallback**: Alternative entropy sources when primary fails
- **Verification**: Multi-source randomness verification
- **Reliability**: Ensures juror selection proceeds even during external service disruptions

### Juror Fraud Protection

- Pre-reveal protection: Revealing votes early allows anyone to report you and claim a portion of your stake
- Cartel protection: Coordinated voting can be detected and penalized
- Evidence of coordination can be reported with serious stake penalties

<Warning>
Never share your vote choice before the reveal phase, and never coordinate with other jurors. This maintains system integrity and protects your PNK.
</Warning>
