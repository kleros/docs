# Kleros Court

<Badge>V2</Badge>

**Kleros Court** is a decentralized dispute resolution protocol that provides arbitration services for smart contracts and decentralized applications. It works by randomly selecting jurors from a pool who are incentivized to resolve disputes honestly through a crypto-economic mechanism based on game theory.

Think of it as a decentralized judiciary for Web3. When a dispute arises, jurors are randomly drawn, they review evidence, vote on the outcome, and the majority decision is enforced—all without centralized intermediaries.

## How It Works

At its core, Kleros works through a simple yet powerful process:

<Steps>

<Step title="Dispute Creation">
  An application encounters a contentious situation and creates a dispute in Kleros, paying arbitration fees.
</Step>

<Step title="Juror Selection">
  Jurors are randomly drawn from those who have staked PNK in the relevant court. Selection probability is proportional to stake.
</Step>

<Step title="Evidence & Voting">
  Jurors review evidence submitted by both parties and cast their votes during the voting period.
</Step>

<Step title="Resolution">
  The majority decision is enforced. Coherent jurors are rewarded; incoherent jurors lose a portion of their stake.
</Step>

</Steps>

### The Incentive Structure

The system is designed so **you don't need to trust anyone**:

- **Jurors** are incentivized to vote honestly (or lose their staked PNK)
- **Disputants** pay fees only for resolution, with no protocol commission
- **Appellants** can challenge rulings by funding additional rounds

This creates a self-policing system where dishonest behavior is economically punished.

## V2 Improvements

Kleros Court V2 represents a significant evolution from V1:

| Feature | V1 | V2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Network** | Ethereum Mainnet | Arbitrum (lower gas costs) |
| **Cross-Chain** | Single chain only | Multi-chain via Vea bridge |
| **Dispute Kits** | Single mechanism | Modular, pluggable kits |
| **Vote Privacy** | Basic commit-reveal | Shutter encryption (in testing) |
| **Staking** | PNK stays in wallet | PNK transfers to contract |
| **RNG** | Single source | Enhanced with fallback mechanisms |

<Note>
Kleros V2 is currently in beta with 100+ disputes successfully processed. The system is undergoing internal review and preparing for external audits.
