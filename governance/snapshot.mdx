# Snapshot Voting

Kleros uses [Snapshot](https://snapshot.box/#/s:kleros.eth) for off-chain governance voting. Snapshot allows PNK holders to vote on proposals using signed messages — no gas fees are required.

---

## How Voting Works

Snapshot voting uses your PNK balance at a specific block height to determine voting power. This means:

- You do **not** need to lock or transfer tokens to vote
- PNK held in your wallet at the snapshot block determines your voting weight
- Voting is gasless — you only sign a message with your wallet
- Results are publicly verifiable through on-chain signatures

<Warning>
If your PNK is held in a smart contract wallet (e.g., a multisig like Gnosis Safe), you need to **delegate** your voting power to another address in order to vote on Snapshot.
</Warning>

## Kleros Snapshot Space

The Kleros governance Snapshot space is **kleros.eth**. It is the official space for all protocol governance votes.

Proposals on this space can cover any governance topic — parameter changes, treasury allocations, new court creation, incentive programs, protocol upgrades, and more.

## After a Vote Passes

Once a Snapshot vote concludes with approval, the decision is enforced through [Kleros Governor](/products/governor):

1. Anyone can submit a transaction list to Governor that implements the approved changes
2. A submission period allows community members to verify the list matches the vote
3. If only one correct list is submitted, it executes automatically
4. If conflicting lists are submitted, Kleros Court arbitrates

This creates a fully decentralized governance pipeline: propose on the forum, vote on Snapshot, execute via Governor — all without centralized intermediaries.
