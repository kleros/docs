# Game Theory & Incentives

Kleros is designed so that honest voting is the **dominant strategy** for jurors. This page explains the game-theoretic foundations that make decentralized dispute resolution work.

---

## The Schelling Point Mechanism

Kleros draws on Thomas Schelling's insight that people who cannot communicate tend to coordinate on "focal points" — the most obvious or natural answer to a question.

In Kleros, jurors are randomly selected, cannot communicate, and must vote independently. They know that:
- Other jurors are also trying to answer honestly
- Voting with the majority earns rewards
- Voting against the majority loses PNK

Given these conditions, the rational strategy for each juror is to vote for what they believe to be the **objectively correct answer** — because that's the answer they expect other honest jurors to also pick. The honest answer becomes the Schelling point.

## The Incentive Structure

Kleros uses two types of economic incentives:

### Arbitration Fees (ETH)

Dispute creators pay fees that are distributed among coherent jurors. If you vote with the final winning answer, you earn a share of the total fees for that round:

```
jurorFeeReward = totalFees / numberOfCoherentVotes
```

### PNK Redistribution

Incoherent jurors lose a portion of their staked PNK (determined by the `alpha` parameter). This PNK is redistributed to coherent jurors:

```
jurorPNKReward = totalPenalties / numberOfCoherentVotes
```

The combination creates a system where honest voting is rewarded from **two independent sources**, while dishonest voting is penalized.

## Attack Resistance

### The 51% Attack Problem

For an attacker to control the outcome of a dispute, they would need to control the majority of drawn jurors. Since jurors are drawn proportionally to staked PNK, this requires controlling a majority of PNK staked in the relevant court.

This is expensive for three reasons:

**Market liquidity defense** — PNK is a purpose-built token. As an attacker buys PNK, supply becomes scarce and the price rises sharply. Unlike attacking with ETH (which has deep global liquidity), buying enough PNK to dominate a court becomes progressively more expensive.

**Appeals escalation** — Even if an attacker wins one round, the honest side can appeal. Each appeal roughly doubles the jury, requiring the attacker to control an ever-larger majority. The cost of sustaining an attack grows exponentially with each round.

**The "Lone Voice of Reason" effect** — If every other juror in a round voted dishonestly, a single honest juror who voted correctly would receive *all* the penalties and fees from that round. This creates a strong incentive for at least some participants to vote honestly even under attack conditions.

### Vote Buying and Collusion

Kleros V2 addresses vote manipulation through several mechanisms:

**Hidden votes** — Commit-reveal voting prevents jurors from proving how they voted, making vote buying unenforceable (the bribed juror can simply lie about their committed vote).

**Juror fraud protection** — Anyone who detects that a juror revealed their vote before the reveal phase can challenge them and claim a portion of their stake.

**Random selection** — Because jurors are drawn randomly, an attacker cannot predict or control which jurors are selected, making targeted bribery difficult.

## Why Honest Jurors Win Long-Term

An honest juror who consistently votes for the truthful answer will, over many disputes, earn more than they lose. The system is designed so that:

- On average, honest jurors are coherent (they agree with the majority)
- The fees and PNK redistributed from incoherent jurors flow to coherent ones
- The expected return from honest voting exceeds the expected return from random or strategic voting

This doesn't mean honest jurors never lose — they may be in the minority in any single round. But the appeals system ensures that persistent minorities can escalate until the truthful answer prevails.

---

## Limitations and Honest Acknowledgments

**Kleros does not guarantee perfect outcomes.** It guarantees that honest voting is economically optimal under the protocol's game-theoretic assumptions. In practice:

- Small disputes with few jurors have higher variance
- Jurors may lack expertise for highly technical disputes (this is why specialized courts exist)
- Disputes with genuinely ambiguous evidence may not have a clear Schelling point

The system mitigates these through court specialization, appeals, and the exponentially growing jury size across rounds.
